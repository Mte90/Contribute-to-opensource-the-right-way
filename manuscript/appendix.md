-# Appendix 1 for Community Managers

## What is a community manager? A Project Maintainer?

There are a lot of resources about this topic but this is my book, so this is my version of that definition.  
First of all a Community Manager is a leader, and this role require you need to delegate and find new areas of business ehm of activity.  
A nice example of community management in a TV series is "Chuck", the BestBuy is a tech supermarket with a lot of different people, background and their various lives. The main character is the de facto leader of the supermarket so others follow him even if he isn't their boss. Listens to the various people, knows them, knows how to moves and be the middle men with the authorities but keep also different lives.  
In our case is not a spy but maybe a father, a worker, comics collector or a pirate.  
Another TV series is "Scrubs" with different characters, various roles, different lives but common interests or workplace that have to coexist for a purpose. Everyone with their needs and different behaviors but despite that they move on.   
I like the pop culture and the reference to cinema/books/comics world because it easy to use the learning transfer (we saw already it in the book) to them and [learn how to do not do things](https://blog.tdwright.co.uk/2020/05/07/9-things-westworld-can-teach-us-about-software-engineering/) or how to manage a company (check Silicon Valley TV series as example).  

Another point is a phrase by [Italo Vignoli](https://twitter.com/italovignoli), one of the founders of The Document Foundation and one of the OSI council members, that said to me about the role term Community Manager *"A community cannot be managed because everyone do what they want"*. For me this is true, you aren't a community manager but more a community leader that create a path where others converge because they trust you, not because someone placed you for that role.

Basically a community manager is like a boss at you same level, that is more skilled on other areas like communication, relationship and has a more wide knowledge in areas that you don't know.  
Often this role is confused with the Project Maintainer or Maintainer, very common in OSS (compared to community manager). A maintainer is a technical role, someone that works to keep a software to get fixes, new features, code reviews, define roadmap, that says no, but this doesn't involve at all that should care also the community.  
About be a project maintainer there are a lot of resources (also in this book) but there are also other guides like [opensource.guide][https://opensource.guide/best-practices/] or [from Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/resources/open-source-guides/winding-down-an-open-source-project/).

A community is a group of people interested in a specific topic that they are pursuing with passion but needs some direction, some management and leading. There are tons of people that are community managers but they don't feel that this role is for them, and probably they are right. Honestly I don't think of myself as a community manager but someone that want the project living and taking this responsibility so others can do what they want (and me too). A good manager is someone that is honest because isn't afraid of discuss about everything with the others, also their ignorance.

## Divide your community members to various levels

As we saw in this book a project can have different areas of involvements or activities and this based on the volunteers availability.  
It is important to organize at the best what you want to do as community manager divide (just for you) the volunteers in various levels so based on your needs you know what kind of people to reach.  
We can define as example in this ways:

* Author/Owner - The creator of a project or the is the leader
* Maintainer - A different role then the above that is doing the hard work of keeping everything work and also checking for issues or new opportunities
* Contributors - People that can work based on their time on specific activities
* Community members - the whole group of people that is moving on the project

This groups of people can have as example different communications or different knowledge of what is the project is doing. Keeping an eye on those will help you to find people "to promote" on different tasks that can require more accountability as example.  
It is important also to understand the kind of users you have in the community and their interests, in the Conclusion chapter in the Other Resources section there are some interesting reading about the various type of people that can exists in a community. This study can help you on decide what is better to do it and engage more the people that you have and new ones.

To know better about the various jargon or meanings from the various kind of users, I suggest to you to check this talk by [Italo at Fosdsem 2020](https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/user_standing/).

## How to do productive discussions

One of the problem in a community that is easy to change the focus or the point of the discussion, in other words to go off-topic. This isn't a specific problem of the meetings but with any discussion from emails to chat.  
My experience taught me that in a chat if you sent 2 messages (not 2 questions in the same message) people will reply to just one, maybe the first one or the last one.  

There are 2 kind of discussions productive or useless, as maintainer or community manager is important to get the maximum to save your time, because communication is a time-consuming task.  
How you can recognize useless discussions? Check this list:

* When are used a lot of hyperbole
* There is a lot of repetition
* There are tons of new ideas without any clear proposal
* Noise detection
  * Comments from inactive people can be very dangerous:
      * They are not aligned with the project status
      * They are just lurking so don't have any experience of the community life of the project
      * Can act as troll because you [just changed their workflow](https://xkcd.com/1172/)
   * Doers are usually silent and is important to reach them

These are basic rules but you need to give a different weight to the your evaluation based also on the previous section. Every volunteer is important but some can have more relevance on the decisions just because they are alive and participating in what you are doing.  

## How to manage a meeting

Meetings can be boring so it’s important to have an agenda with strict times to be sure not to forget something or keep at pace with the plan itself.  
During the meeting take few minutes to talk about the purpose of the meeting (also on the invitation email/communication) and the workflow of the meeting.  
Preparing the attendees it’s important to improve the quality of the meeting itself and to be proud of what was done during this time, so it is not going to be a boring meeting.  
The agenda of the meeting is important, and also the titles of the various moments that help to remember the topics (a nice tip can be to add a prefix on your communication like "Website localization - First steps" or "Event organization 2020 - Venue").  
The order too, put on top the topics with more priority, avoid jargon during the meeting and don’t forget to leave time to reply to questions and also the last words to the attendees.  
Don’t forget that someone needs to get notes of the meetings for the people that missed it and to write a report, also define a specific amount of time to avoid off topic discussions and be on track.  
At the same time can be important to have a moment during the meeting for open floor questions but just define in it on your agenda so everyone can plan what to ask in that slot.

### When

The new volunteers need to participate to feel a part of a big team so is useful to do one monthly, biweekly or weekly meeting about the status.  
When you are working on a specific project you can organize other meetings with their plan and specific people.  
It’s important the timing of meeting is chosen gathering team’s availability, and remains almost unchanges during the iterations to avoid issues.  
There are 3 type of meeting:

* Live meeting: meeting people in real life it’s important but you always need an agenda with very strict timings
* Online Text meeting: these meetings have a little agenda of 2 or 3 points and someone directs them. They are helpful to vote because they are very quick and can cather to many people and are easy to follow for new people that don’t need to join express their opinions. At the same time they can be made public to allow many people to follow them.
* Online Video meeting: Like live meetings but online. In that meeting the people can be easily distracted or bored so look on the agenda.

These are rules for all the volunteers, but they are important for a new volunteer!  
Because they show you are very well organized and motivate him to join in the next; also don’t forget to say hi to the new volunteers and ask them for a little introduction of themselves.

## How to approach a problem/improvement or how to organize a new project/team

In every team there are discussions about new ideas or problems/blockers that need to be solved and there are different tricks to speed up and define a roadmap.

* Try explaining only with words what are the goal of that, Ex:
 * Get fun
 * Accountability
 * Involve
 * Recruiting

This points will be your compass on the discussion (also will invite others on helping you because the goal is the same), also a reference or the reason of the plan itself!  
Gather ideas with these words to speed up the process (is the first step) and you can do it in one of the many ways already explained.  
Also, you need a person who will be the lead of every step, not multiple but one or two.

Start also with few people but clear goals and a clear purpose. Create a group with similar skills in that way they can focus better and follow a usual way to do things for their type of skills.  

Also, doesn’t forget to classify the various tasks for skills, so is simpler for you to assign it (and get a result), but also find the good first task for newcomers. You always need simple things for new people because this is the part that shows how much is easy to join the project or contribute to it (consider busy people, they want to contribute too).

Don’t forget to organize periodic meetings!

### Analyze a problem or improvement

After the organization of the meeting the workflow after that will be to organize the priorities and:

* You are in a team, even if you are the leader, so ask for feedback or a solution
* Create a user story or a persona
* Select a precise number of people for feedback
* Ask questions also if the solution is already known
* Nothing is foregone
* Leave of the info about this situation
* Pick few goals and make a comparison between today and ahead
* Don’t forget that coaching is different to feedback
* Don’t forget that the attendees are not you
* Lead by example
* Say thank you at the end of the meetings and on feedback
* 5 why
    * This approach came from the agile method, it consists in asking for 5 times why in a cascade way about the problem to go deeper in a simple way to analyze later and know the environment when the problem showed up

With this approach you will improve the relation with people and also the organization and became more able to analyze the problems. No more boring meetings!

## How to communicate

Communication is the core business of a community where the feedback is the fundamental rule (check also the next appendix about this topic).  
Also, don’t forget to avoid Jargon or explain it when you use it.  
In every communication it’s better to follow the rule of 7 communications.  

* **Completeness**
    * Be complete in everything in your communication to avoid losing time and allowing you to be more productive, as example define goals.
* **Conciseness**
    * Complete of course but also concise to simplify the reading. More text means more mistakes. As for developers, more code means more bugs somewhere. TED talks seems to have the rule to expose the plan in 12 seconds.
* **Consideration**
    * Don’t forget that your audience needs to follow you so it’s important text is understandable from everyone of your audience.
* **Concreteness**
    * The object of the communication needs to be complete and clear to everyone (maybe evaluate the use of future tense). Dividing the communications into different points is very helpful.
* **Courtesy**
    * No negativity, not be the victim and be open. It can help with all of your messages.
* **Clearness**
    * The message need to be understood not for the amount of words or the quality of the language but for the context. Putting the proof before the conclusion is the TED way or inductive reasoning.
* **Correctness**
    * Be sure of everything that you are saying to avoid conflicts or misunderstanding.

I> "Inductive reasoning is distinct from deductive reasoning. While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument may be probable, based upon the evidence given." [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning)

When you have no idea where to start with a communication the simple way is writing a list with every point, prioritize and only then writing your message.  
Because you are part of an open project, you need to do open questions to the people too. These open questions are not for better clarification but let the others explain what they mean, because a lot of things are not specifically communicated with words for example.

There are different tasks about communication and for a community managers is important to keep a public communication on high quality standards, to save time but also to be more transparent, create an history, create a workflow and improve the reputation of your project. There are 2 ways for that: gather the common questions of newcomers of the community and create some sort of documentation or keep a period report of what is happening/ed in a project. Those are simple ways to improve the quality of communication in your project that on long term can have a lot of benefits.

## How to talk with people

* Don’t criticize, condemn, nor recriminate
    * In this way your position as leader is friendly and you can create a different atmosphere where people, even when doing wrong things, can continue to work and experiment
* Compliments, even for little things, are important for the people involved because they see that you care about what they are doing. You need be honest of course!
* You are a leader so you need to be an example for them to motivate the others to do the same
* As leader you need to know about “your people” so keep updated about their life
* Smile because no one wants to see sad people
* Let other people talk about themselves and their ideas/suggestions
* Talk about the stuff that interests the audience
    * As we have already seen in this doc it’s very important to get attention from the audience that because that is what you want
* How to persuade others
    * Avoid discussions to be the winner again. You are a person like the others so be human!
    * Respect the others ideas/thoughts
    * If you are wrong admit that as fast as you can before the situation goes worse
        * Start a discussion about a comparison with your experience that was worst and see if the audience is doing better. In that way are you more friendly and human.
        * At same time in a discussion is helpful to start from a point where both the parties agree, so it is possible to prepare a ground to move further the discussion
    * Be always friendly
    * Make questions because only the people humbling in front of others are human and friendly because even if you are the boss they need help from you. No orders to you people!
    * The reputation even if people are wrong is important so let them “save” themselves so they will perceive you as a good leader
    * Motivate of course, because with the wrong mood is difficult to accomplish something
    * The audience need to be happy to do what are you saying
    * Convince people to agree with you from the start of the conversation
        * This way is very powerful to convince people, usually start from a common topic letting you introduce more topics which initially the others are not interested in. Ex: Chrome spies you a lot about what you do while surfing the net but Firefox does not and at the same time it’s very customizable with other things
    * Let others talk
        * Again let the people share their thoughts so you can find more points of discussions
    * Let others have the idea
        * For example you want a new feature, discuss with a developer about the issue, probably he can improve it and fix it for you
    * Think as one of the audience
    * Challenge with them
        * Competition often can create a good mood and spirit inside the community

## How to write reports

Every community to be transparent needs to write report about everything from an event, meeting or a roadmap.

All the points about communications can be used for that but there are more things not to be forgotten to help you write a report that is helpful after a year or to people wanting to join you with no background because often reports are public.

* Divide the discussion into different points
* These points are the important stuff that needs to be separated from the rest for better readability
* For every point write a tiny sentence
* When finished review all the points and start improving on the sentences
* Probably you will see that you need to add more points
* Add photo or external resources to improve the quality of the report
* Don’t forget to indicate at the beginning the names of the people that joined
    * Also, remember the compliments
* Divide the discussion on a daily basis to show the progress
* Don’t forget to do a recap about:
    * What you learn in the event
    * What are the first step to take
    * What are the problems identified
    * What you like of this event and what are the problems and where there is an improvement margin
* Probably it’s to soon for a time line but a draft can be very helpful

T> Don’t forget to do yearly reports, campaign reports or other kind of reports. They are useful to show the status and how much community is healthy, they are easy to share online and improve the project brand.

## Why you need a script for your next event

This is something that I learned in Mozilla, with new volunteers at their first public event or talking the first time from the booth.  
The big issue was everytime they didn’t know what to reply to X or Y, so how can you help them to be more comfortable?  
Quite easy, do a list of topics with a recap about the status or description to share before the events, in this way the volunteers have a reference to study, they learn something new and you are more relaxed during the event.  
About the topic: it is on you, usually they are chosen from: the most famous, the most discussed on internet, the biggest new features, a common issue and also the frequently asked questions.

## Communication channels

Every culture has differences but there are few rules that apply for everyone.

* Facebook groups: they can be a mess because there is no moderation of the texts and can become very spammy
* Facebook Messenger: it’s a chat and requires you to add every new person on your Facebook, that usually it’s private so not everyone wants to add everyone on it
* Telegram: is the best choice because has bots, link previews, moderation tools, links/media recap, client desktop/mobile and is open source (there are open source addicts that don’t want to use proprietary software)
* Hangouts/Hangouts Meet/Zoom/Jitsi: it’s useful online for video meetings but remember it allows a maximum of 10 people on the free plan
* IRC: it’s the classic solution on open source to chat but for the new generation and for the mobile world it’s too difficult to configure and understand
* Matrix/Slack-like: it is a IRC 2.0 that may improve the organization in groups of people and usually a bridge between IRC and Telegram can improve the migration. Slack have problems on onboarding new people because the free plan is very limited to 10000 messages (also on private groups and is very easy to reach that). It is not open source and there are many alternatives without that problem. This tools, like Telegram or Matrix have integrations such as bots.
* Mailing list: like IRC they can be annoying but some community still uses and is not possible to avoid them, they can be very noisy but you can get answers more easily as a lot of people is following them
* Discourse or forum: with a modern interface they work very well with notification and other stuff
* Collaborative Documents: they are important to work together on a plan. Etherpad in the open source world are the best, but they are very poor in features like: comments or suggest changes, notification and classic features of a text editor. Usually Google Docs are used, covering all those features but the urls are very complicated and some people don’t like that because they are not open source.
