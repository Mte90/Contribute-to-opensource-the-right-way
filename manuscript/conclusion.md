-# Conclusion

## What is the future of the open source world in the next years?

Open source was a scary topic years ago, they used to see you as an amateur. This is a fake new today, it is also that but not always. Only because it is free doesn’t imply that it’s an amateur thing but it can be a good alternative.  
Do you know Volvo invented the seat belts but the patent was set up as free to use for all to improve the security for everyone?  
I think we need people discovering how the open world changed everything already, and give to them the opportunities from time slot in their job as example.  

From the routers in every house to connect to the internet, that are cheap because of open source technologies allowing internet to spread everywhere and so on.  
We as people need to let the rest of the world be more conscious for what there is around, as we are doing with climate change.  
Take as example the power of the **Open Data**, that in some countries are unknown or discouraged from the public governments (I am pointing my finger to you Italy) and how much they can change the approach to the big archives that every country has.

The future is “We need more conscious people in all the topics”, with internet we have the knowledge within a tap’s reach (not only a click with the mouse) but we are not using it the right way. We need to consider the idea that they don’t know something and need to understand what they miss, in this case why their using something and if there is something better for different reasons.

Basically we need to move on those points (explained in the next sub chapters):

* From “Let’s migrate to Open Source because is free” to “Let’s migrate to Open Source because it offers more features”
* Evolve the concept of the license
* Be more user-friendly
* Get better promotion

### Use Open Source software because is better not because is free

Just this title has some issues because Open Source != free, take as example  WordPress ecosystem or other CMSs where additional software is sold but the code is public (and not obfuscated/minified). A software can be open source but this doesn’t mean that it’s free, it needs to follow the 4 freedoms that don’t mention the money factor.

We as community and users need to move on the open to this new level, it isn’t anymore a matter of money as before. Taking as example LibreOffice having to compete with Office 365 that is a cloud service sold to public governments and is cheaper than Office suite to install in the computers.  
So IT departments prefer Office 365 because they don’t need to take care of supporting it, installing it and so on (welcome to the cloud baby) but this opens the door to other questions. Where are the files hosted? In what country? There are secret/privacy information on them? If I cancel the subscription what it’s going to happen?  
Open source lets you run software in cloud, but we need to change the approach on promoting it because the old slogans don’t work anymore.  

This was the way people abandoned Internet Explorer, not because Firefox (the biggest competitor at the time) was free but because it was better, as Media player against VLC, WinZip against WinRAR (everyone used it without buying it), WinRAR against 7zip etc. too.  
Now people don’t think to these tools anymore if they have better ones (biggest example Firefox Vs Chrome or Chrome Vs Chromium).  

This is also part of the fact that big companies and a lot of projects in the world use open source components without giving anything back, no money or other types of contribution. The biggest disadvantage of open source basically, but that it’s not the right way to work in the open source world properly. Those days there was a lot of discussions about funding an open source project or the maintainer itself, it’s not very easy but is something that the users should ask every time they use something for free.

### Evolve the concept of the license

It is cool to get the source code but is quite useless if it is not possible to run it. It is like when I got a Blu-ray DVD as birthday gift but I had only a DVD player that wasn’t supporting it.  
Today with the cloud we need to understand that the code access is enough to be open.  
[Frank Karlitschek](https://karlitschek.de/2019/08/open-source-if-more-than-licenses/) (the creator of Owncloud and Nextcloud) explained very well the issue. The 4 freedoms were created when the computer in the home was the unique way to access a software, now with cloud and mobiles there are different kinds of resources. Access to the code was enough to get Digital freedom, but now it isn’t anymore. Our data are not anymore our files but also our interests, our photos and so on.  

Open source is for me when:

* The code is open source
* There is a community leading the project (behind a company too, like in Docker, Kubernetes, or Arduino)
* There is no Dictator (like in Python, PHP)
* All the files to use it are provided (like Machine learning models as Mozilla’s DeepSpeech with Common Voice)
* Everything is documented and following a standard
* Release management is not happening at the time of major releases only with a cadence of 3-4 months (or less) (people need to be aware of the changes and to be able to deploy without any hurry)

### User friendly because not all the people love the command line

A common problem years ago was that open source software was very ugly or difficult to use even if powerful.  
Now that has changed but not all the projects are offering user friendlyness, this is a problem that requires more people testing and also more UI designers helping with that.  
The [Open Source Design](https://opensourcedesign.net/) community is the first example, also KDE with their [Usability & Productivity](https://pointieststick.com/category/usability-productivity/) newsletter and Mozilla with [weekly updates from the nightly version](https://blog.nightly.mozilla.org/) or [The Document Foundation](https://blog.documentfoundation.org) that often release stats or updates about the projects.  
User friendly is not only a better UI or cool logo (that changes every few months, yes Mozilla I am talking to you) but informing the people about the updates during the cycle to involve them more.    
Other projects involve them more because they offer more news and people can *gossip* like a TV series, well humans are simple sometimes and is something that the open community can replicate.  

Communicating better and being more friendly in everything (the purpose of this book indeed) are the future.

### Communicate better to fight who has the money to sponsor everywhere

The legend that “if it is on all the billboards it means it is good” is not true. The high competition in the digital world changed everything.  

We can promote it without money, if we make that together and if the project provides the promotional materials.  
In this case not graphics assets or gadgets but data to share. The scandals of the last years with social networks have exposed the fact that data are the new currency that if used the right way may also change an election, so le’ts figure out how to use it to promote the open philosophy better.  
Not only the machine wants data but also people because we are in the world where facts don’t matter and only real data, a lot of it, can change this bias.  

Open source needs more marketers, a sector that often isn’t involved in open source because they don’t care (maybe) but it’s a fact that we need them.

## Thanks

As I already said, I decided to write this book because I wanted to gather all the things I documented over the years, my thoughts and share my experiences.  
My experience level couldn't be as it is now without the help of a lot of people:

![Scasciafratte's last family trip in 2015 in Milan](images/extra/family.jpg)  

* My family because they taught me that "A lot of people talk about how to do things and very few on doing them". Without this imprinting, and without my Catholic faith too, is very difficult to imagine my involvement in Open Source. As humans, we have the power to change the world around us, complaining is right only when people eat pineapple on pizza.
* My collegue and associate, Eugenio Petullà, that allowed me to be free during work because what we do for open source is important and brings value to our web agency and our skills. I know that he uses Fedora and Gnome and I use Debian Sid and KDE, but I am trying to ignore this problem.
* Edoardo Viola, leading with me the Mozilla Italia community, who helped me on confronting with others and cooperating in the leadership of a community too. He is a professor now and I hope to get a good rating for this book, but please no oral interview!

* The founders (Marco and Vincenzo) of Industria Italiana del Software Libero, may our idea to create a national group of IT professionals in Italy be an achievable dream and not only a group of friends (Also Emilio, Stefano and Giancarlo).
* WordPress community, even with all the issues I have with the actual project management I am still involved because I trust the people more than the project itself (now).
* To all the other people in other communities that it’s always a pleasure to meet and chat with: Italo Vignoli, Enio Gemmo, Giordano Alborghetti, Gabriele Ponzo, Gianfranco Buttu, Roberto Guido, Marina Latini, Saverio Giulio Malatesta, Emiliano Valvassori, Dario Cavedon, Fabio Pietrosanti, Luca Martinelli.
* All the reviewers for their time and lots of patience on finding English mistakes and suggesting new things that I forgot: Rizki D Kelimutu, Marco Lombardo, Elisabetta Carrara, Konstantina Papadea, Michele Nasti, Takeshi Hamasaki, Stefano Cassone, André Jaenisch.
