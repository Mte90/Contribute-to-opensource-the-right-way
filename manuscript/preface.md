-# How to read this book
I always wanted to write that sentence and this book allowed me to do it!  
This is not my first e-book, during the years I have written a few (for niches) in Italian - probably unknown to many, but important to have fun learning.  
During high school (2005/2009) I wrote "Principi di programmazione" (Development Principles) and I released the second edition years later (I think very few people read it), I wrote it mainly for myself, but opted for a public format for it.  
Later, I have written a guide of 12 pages for [Python and Qt](https://daniele.tech/2013/04/ebook-introduzione-a-pyqt-1-edizione/) in Italian (developers' stuff) and the [2 edition](https://daniele.tech/2015/04/introduzione-a-pyqt-2-edizione/) in Italian.  
I have written also a guide of few pages ["WordPress per il cliente"](https://daniele.tech/2014/10/wordpress-per-cliente-rev-0-0-4/) (WordPress for the customer) in 2012.  
This is not my first rodeo, this time the topic is serious and big with a lot of my opinions and the explanation of my personal approach to things.  

## What you will find

The book follows my mind flow from why and how I started and what I learned, based on my lectures but also a lot of experience, in few words this is my view about the topic.  
In this way you have a (big) tutorial in the open source life to individually create your path.  
There will be memes (I love them) and funny images like my writing style on the blog or talks, because this book is written in an informal way.   
If you want to read it because *I need to learn, make money and became famous* here you will find nothing for you, check on Udemy or somewhere else.  
A person not engaged, not interested on the long term is already failing on contributing.

I> I like to generalize often in my thoughts and discussions. So this book can seems like that but is my way of thinking to simplify the issue or the discussion itself. As a developer is important to see the real problem and the frame but they don't need to be managed together. 

## What are the hints of this book

Information, suggestions, procedure, workflow, best practices.  
It begins from the basic stuff to my (new) way of doing things and intro to do the first steps.  
The technical terms will be explained (the first time) to help Newbies and non-tech people at their first approach to the matter.  
The open world is *open* to everybody so this book will serve to explaining things.  
See you at the index!

## License

This book is licensed under the GPLv3 license because I like it, maybe not the best one for a book but is like a mention to remember how much this license changed the world.  
Just to mention it, I made a tool called [GH-License](https://github.com/Mte90/GH-License) that help you to check if your repository include a license, if your repo on GitHub/Bitbucket/etc include it and to download automatically.  

Remember **a project that you can download with all the code doesn't mean that is open source** if doesn't include a license. Without a license is a proprietary project!

## Tools used 

This book is written in Markdown using [ReText](https://github.com/retext-project/retext), released on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mte90/Contribute-to-opensource-the-right-way) and published to [leanpub.com](https://leanpub.com/contributetoopensource-therightway/).  
The language was reviewed using [LanguageTool.org](https://languagetool.org/), [Grammark](https://grammark.org/dist/) and [Sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/html_node/index.html).

An example of what means contribute to open source is part of this tools. When I written the first edition I did it with just ReText that has a big problem, also it has a tab UI when you open a new file from the file manager start a new instance, so I did a [patch that now is part of ReText](https://github.com/retext-project/retext/pull/476) that enable to use an unique instance.

## Legend

With the *open source* term usually we refer to a lot of things, from software projects to others like open knowledge (as Wikipedia), so the term (*open* or *open source*) in this book as to be intended as a big view about the philosophy of the project itself and the approach of the community.
