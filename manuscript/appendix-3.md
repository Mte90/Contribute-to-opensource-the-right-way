-# Appendix 3 for Mentors

## Open source is not for everyone

There is this huge misconception that because it’s free it’s for everyone. Excluding the fact that open source doesn’t mean that it’s free this is basically wrong.  
People are interested in different things, who in dressing, who on sports, who on improving the awareness about the quality of the technologies around us.  
Who is contributing to open source often is part of the last group, maybe is someone curious because it’s a user or because he found something that involves also the other interest’s areas.  

I> For example, I started coding my first website at 16 years old about... Dragon Ball, so pursuing my focus moved to develop games about it...

All this kinds of people need to be always motivated to do more or better to move on the focus of the project.  
Also, you sometimes need a break or to be engaged again, it’s a continuous work to stimulate them that someone should do in the right way.  
People need to be gratified for what they do, in different ways and this is on you.  
The coaching way of doing things is very helpful on motivating but also on optimizing a lot of common issues or tasks on project/people management. Coaching means that people around you succeed and it is something that you want in an OSS project.

## What it means to be a mentor

The mentor is a person that follows you during your volunteers journey and needs to be ready for this task.  
Also, his/her personal experience in the project or skills are very important. You are the first mentee of yourself because you approached probably the same issues, and you probably resolved them so you can give help quickly and easily.  
It happens that people don’t want to be involved as mentors because is time consuming, requires a lot of patience and a good mindset in communication and skills too.  
This doesn’t mean that you need all them but for sure being skilled in communication is important, because people will ask you a lot of things and on the way you reply, they will define how much they can trust in you and what they can ask you.  
Who wants to talk to a rude person (and probably who likes pineapple pizza)? You will find someone that is more friendly, but this doesn’t mean that you need to be a friend, only someone that you can talk to and that don’t bites you.  

A pragmatic analysis I get from the role mentor came from the article [Why we stopped making Einsteins](https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-we-stopped-making-einsteins?s=r), where the reason basically is the fact that they had a tutor, or they got a personal teacher at home. This let them grow from the experience of skilled people that was shared to them when they were very young people.  
A mentor is sharing own experience to others to let them grow with that like this book, just because we want to improve the world itself.

The Mentor's path:

* Analyze what kind of activities require a mentor and why
    * Verify the priority
* Be a friend/supporter of the mentee
* Understand the skills of the mentee
    * Help in case of missing skills
* Help people in doing activities that generate experience
* Be frank, constructive and work together for the value of the mentee itself
* Define your expectations
* Lead by example

There are two approaches for a mentor that are Formal or Informal and this depends on the type of activity.  
The best way to be a mentor is not Authoritative or Democratic but in a Coaching way that is the best for educational and quality of the friendship in this task.  
The coaching way is very simple and requires skills for specific activities as already explained in the document.  

I> Don’t forget that the relationship with a mentor is a long journey and requires a full view of the activities and goals.

You will fight between two aspects that are Convention vs Consistency, and they are both important. So you need to balance that in your routine!

Conventions are your workflow or the community convention on tasks, that you need to put in the plan but as mentor you need also to be elastic on managing the Consistency. Because you are helping a new volunteer that doesn’t understand them probably, so initially you need to see which rules you can ignore and later “migrate” everything with the mentee.

## Motivate your mentees

The volunteers need to be motivated in their activities so don’t forget to ask feedback on the activityitself about:

* What works? What doesn’t?
* What would you like to do?
* Do you think these activities helped you to learn something? What?
* Do you think the workflow can be improved?

Remember feedback are important to gather information but also to give trust to the volunteer to be a part of a community and not a single and alone piece of a puzzle.

The rules are:

* Don’t be defensive or against feedback but document all them, because they can help in a manner that you now don’t imagine, in the future.
* each out often to the mentee or you will lose the volunteer, so get in touch twice a month it’s the best timing initially (to not become annoying).

Remember feedback are not useful to improve only the activity/project but also yourself, to learn how to ask the right question in the right moment.  
Every feedback needs to be explained to understand what is going on, yes or no are not enough.  
Basically without context everything can be misconfused from everyone.

Also, you have to ask feedback to the volunteer to understand what’s going on:

* Do you like to work on this project?
* Do you like to work in this team?
* What you want to do next?
* What was the main or bigger problem in the last months during activities? 
* What are your activities like when you are proud of yourself?
* Did you learn something new?
* Did you need it a mentoring in the last months?
* Did you help someone as mentor?

The mentoring period depends on your needs but the ideal is one month because the people can remember better what they have done.  
Also, trust the feedback from people with experience but also the feedback from new people because they have a different point of view.

T> When a new product is in alpha/beta status is not good to send to review to all the influencers or investors. Instead it’s sent to a group of testers to validate the assumptions, and this can be done also inside the community. This can help to draft a better activity or roadmap that later can be disclosed or discussed with all the community. This helps on avoiding forgetting something and checking that the testers are aligned and can understand everything. What will happen when you disclose something that wasn’t analyzed in the right way? Noise, discussions, ranting, rumors and so on. Open source doesn’t need them so often even if everyone loves *flame wars*.

### How to fight demotivation

Demotivation happens usually for 3 reasons:

* Lacking confidence on the project/activity
    * You need to understand the reason and create confidence
* Poor results
    * Define new objects and understand what was the reasons
* Hints not enough
    * Ask yourself what it's missing and do it

The conflicts also happen for the same reasons but also for:

* Missing information
* Goals not defined

To improve and avoid these problems usually you can start to improve the communications because often the misunderstanding is there.
