-# Appendix 2 for Tech Speakers

This appendix is not just for developers or people that spoke fluently Jargon. It is open to everyone that need to talk about tech or need to improve communication skills.

## Schema to expose at the best your thoughts

* Explain a choice
  * Using the time as your ally to convince more the people use the rule: Blame is for past, Values for present, Choice for the future. Write your proposal in this way help you to define in the mind what was before and what you are proposing using as base the real situation. Can be something easy to understand but often during discussion we confuse the verb tense, in this way you are processing and writing the information in the most clear way.
  * Write in 3 steps: describe benefits, show that is easy, show how defeat the other option. Before to show the conclusion you can leave also few options or alternatives.
* Understand the target
  * If you want to sell a washing machine you need to know if the customer is one that clean plates on his own or prefer to trash them. As you are proposing something you need to define the target or the audience, in this way you can change the language, terms but also explain differently.
* Where is the value
  * People will listen you more clearly if you are talking using your experience or anecdotes. As humans we love a story, also if we can identify ourself, this way to expose things is the way used in TED talks.

## Ways to get inspiration (especially for funny facts) 

The idea is that every talk should contain part of our life as a person to better explain the topic and why we care.  
It is also better if we can add funny facts to add more reality but also a different tone to the speech given to the audience.

## How to talk to the audience

If you have never given a speech to an audience the first issues are going to be:

* I have no idea where to start
* I am not a good speaker
* I am afraid of the public
* I have nothing interesting to say 

How to fight these thoughts?

* Take inspiration from others!
    * Pretty simple look how others talk even of different topics. Consider interviews of famous actors to understand that is not so difficult too. Watch Ted Talks for example or search on YouTube for talks.
* Start with a simple and tiny goal, step by step!
    * For example draft a presentation and try it in your room
* Be positive about your talk! Without this everything that you will do in your life will be a mess.
    * Don’t start with apologies because people don’t like them. They are here to listen about your topic!
* Practice is the way, also taking the time to recorded
    * On the long run your recordings are the best way to see where you have to improve
* Fear of the public is helpful to do better
    * Fear is a way to empower us to fight it, to do what we want
* Don’t memorize but practice; is better for your "show"
    * Memory is for poetry, you need to speak with your feelings on the sleeve
* Take your time before starting to reorder your thoughts and be more fluid
    * Usually prepare a schema of your points for the slide that will be your talk path
* Take confidence with the topic of course! I don’t want to listen to someone who talks about something that he doesn’t know, because I am losing my time.
    * People come to the event to listen to you, give them something that deserves their time
* The topics are better when coming from your personal background
    * As per the previous point, every topic that is personal is better to give more trustability about what you are saying
* Put examples in your talk because everyone can follow them and are very attractive and easy to explain
    * It is demonstrated that stories, jokes, graphs and images can be helpful examples to let people remember easily your points
* If you have no idea where to start:
    * Use a question or a quote
    * With an image
    * With stats
* Details improve the quality of your talk
    * With the personal experience 
    * With strange situations that can be hilarious or easy to explain and get to the point
    * Statistics are objective and very easy to understand
* Why you are here, you are a human and people want to know why are you here
    * Again personal experience does the difference
* First issues about the topic and how to resolve them
    * People go to events to learn how to do better or discover new things
* Be part of the public
    * Say what the people want to listen and understand your audience
* Keep your tone of voice in check, don’t speak at a monotone rate or you’ll be boring for the audience
* Eye contact is important, there are different ways
    * Look for a far away point in the middle of the audience
    * Look specific people that are interested
* Don’t give never your back to the audience
* Your posture needs to be relaxed and confident
* When you want to do a comparison about stereotypes or experiences never generalize to avoid issues with people that fit in that only for a part and avoid conflicts

Don’t forget that every discussion as 4 points:

* Persuade
* Inform
* Convince
* Entertain

If your talk or discussion has all the points it will be probably an amazing experience for the audience!

These points are not mandatory but helpful to get ready and draft your talk.

Your backup sentences in case of issues:

* If your joke falls, say "Pretend it was serious"
* If you lose your train of thought: "Sometimes silence says a lot, but not this time" or ask the audience "What I was saying?" when someone reminds you "Oh cool, someone was listening"
* If the room is too hot say a joke about the thermostats melted and you can't change it or if it is cold you can say that you saw few penguins around that want to follow the presentation
* A big noise outside the room "That’s what we do to people who try to escape my talk"
 
## How to write a talk

* Don’t forget to talk about yourself, you are the guru for that topic for the attendees
* Usually the first 5 minutes are very important because the audience is going to decide if your talk is interesting or not
    * So an introduction of the topic can be very important
* Show a concrete example/way to fix a statement
* Be specific when you can and generic to be more serious on what you are saying
* Identify the problems of your proposal
* Start every slide with the important part of the content (it will be easier to remember)
* Think about the audience skills
* Identify as a person with that problem, what do you want to listen to?
    * What you are trying to promote
    * The topic points focused simply
* Understand the mindset of the technology you are talking about
    * Flames are not very good during a live talk
* Create in your mind a boilerplate version that follows the slides and an advanced version, to be used for an audience with more skills where you can use the slides as reference to explain more in depth
* You are not a teacher, you are a person with experience in that topic and you want to show your experience
* Simplify, it’s important but don’t forget that sometimes it’s not the best way, but you can divide the topic into different slides
* The people can forget the focus so act like a showman to gather the attention from them
    * Funny images (I am addicted of GIF animated or meme)
    * Quotes are difficult to remember or to understand for an audience that doesn’t know that quote
* When you write a new talk try to understand if the slides order is right or you are missing something
* The practice is very important
* The title talk needs to be interesting and curious
    * Use a title generator to gather inspiration
* Empathize few words help to conveying a message
* The slides need to be useful also without attending the talk itself or remembering it
    * Many slides with only images in that case are not very useful
* Last slide for question with your data like email and a link to see the slides again
    * I also have a page with the list of all my talks, in that way they can find also other things

### Improve the talk

* A talk without improvements it’s not a good talk
* The world evolves with new technologies and things so it’s important to update it
* If you get often the same questions in your talk, add that information in the talk itself
* The slides can't change but the way you explain the things can change based on the audience
* Improve the examples, often they need to be updated because for example after a year it’s not working anymore

T> ### Tips

T> * The talk need to be done in standing up
T> * No stop words like ehm uhm but in that case stay silent
T>     * o exercise talk about something for 30 seconds and register it and listen to it. Repeat until you will stop to say them. Do it for different subjects for weeks every day, this can help you speed up on building sentences on your mind.
T>     * You need to hear on recordings when you are saying them, in that way you can prevent them, is difficult but on the long run you will see the effects
T> * Try to practice the talk before the talk
T> * Check all the slides and the content before the talk
T> * Arrive in the room 30 minutes before your talk to check if everything is fine
T> * Train yourself on improvisation, try the Battledeck (or Powerpoint Karaoke) with friends. It is a slide deck with random images where the participant have a specific amount of time to talk about the same topic.

## How to write a tech article

Every tech speaker sooner or later will write a tech article or manage the personal blog.

Let’s see which are the best rules for this task (helpful also on preparing a talk).

* The title need to be intriguing
    * If you have no idea for a title, use a title generator like [http://www.title-generator.com/index.php/best-online-title-generator.html](http://www.title-generator.com/index.php/best-online-title-generator.html) 
* Start with a question, an image or with stats
* Start the paragraph with the important topic and later on explain it
* Divide the content into paragraph to avoid the "text wall effect"
* Break the line when a specific point was completed
    * It is helpful to avoid repetition
    * On the same block the same concept
* Conclude with a strong image to enforce your point (memes usually are the best option)
* What is the purpose of the article? 
* Order the information using this schema:
    * 1st point:
        * tart with the same knowledge ground of the reader, example: your topic is about a new javascript library, the reader probably now has no idea about what to do so it is better to start by explaining what was required to do before the introduction of this library
        * Put at the top the important things to explain later
        * Start with a simple example or point to be comfortable to the audience
    * 2nd point
        * Talk about news, details or with advanced view
    * 5th W order
        * 1st point
            * What, When, Where
        * 2nd point
            * Why, How

* When you want to do a reference about something already written few lines above do a little excerpt of that to avoid to the reader to lose the reading point
* Every item of a list need to start with a different word
* Avoid text block with a lot of text, better to split them
* Metaphors or analogies are more easily remembered by the reader, especially at the top
* When you are using a technical term explain it on the first use
* Be original with your content!
    * An example can be to start from the conclusion and explain with the content. In that way the reader already knows what will be the focus and can be more interested
* Every text need to explain at maximum only 3 ideas and develop the surrounding content
    * 3 ideas are enough because the reader will more easily remember them
* Remove the excessive things that are not important for your content
* Put "Sources" or external link improve the quality of the content (and a bit the SEO)
* Don’t forget to ask feedback on the content
* Don’t forget that you are writing to inform the reader, so what is missing to him to understand the content?
* The use of paragraphs let you do a brainstorming based on these blocks, and every block is helpful to reach the conclusion
* Don’t forget that example case are very easy to remember to the reader
