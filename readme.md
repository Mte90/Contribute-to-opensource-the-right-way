## Description

Open Source is a trending topic today but how you can learned all or some of the skills required to create or contribute to a project opened to the world? This book is my experience in the last 12 years, what I learn and what are the best practice from someone in the field.

## Teaser

Open Source is a topic that today is used also outside the IT world but nobody talks about how to be part of it, instead only to be a consumer or how can be profitable.

Rome wasn't build in a day but all the streets lead to Rome, we have all the streets but we are missing capable people to keep this world growing and improving.

Be a part of the open source world can be the 21 century skills that you deserve?
